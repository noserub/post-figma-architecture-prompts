## Decision Tree

### What type of project are you building?

**Browser Extension?**
→ Start with **Prompt 5c: Browser Extension Architecture**
→ Then follow standard sequence

**Web App with AI features?**
→ Follow standard sequence
→ Add **Prompt 5a: AI Integration** after Prompt 3

**Web App with audio/video?**
→ Follow standard sequence
→ Add **Prompt 5b: Audio Optimization** after Prompt 2

**Collaborative/Real-time app?**
→ Follow standard sequence
→ Add **Prompt 5d: Real-time Features** after Prompt 3

**Standard web app?**
→ Follow standard sequence (Prompts 1-4)

## Best Practices

### 1. Run Prompts in Order
Each prompt builds on the previous one. Don't skip steps.

### 2. Take Notes
Document any customizations or decisions made during each prompt.

### 3. Test After Each Prompt
Verify that the changes work correctly before moving to the next prompt.

### 4. Customize as Needed
These prompts are templates. Adapt them to your specific project requirements.

### 5. Reference Working Examples
All patterns are based on proven production architectures. Reference working examples when implementing.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Prompt doesn't apply to my project"**
- Check if you're using the right prompt sequence
- Browser extensions need Prompt 5c first
- Some prompts are optional based on project type

**"Code doesn't work after running prompt"**
- Check that you ran the prompts in the correct order
- Verify that all dependencies are installed
- Check the console for error messages

**"Performance is still slow"**
- Make sure you ran Prompt 3: Performance Optimization
- Check that lazy loading is implemented
- Verify that images are optimized

**"Database errors"**
- Ensure Prompt 2: Database Architecture was run
- Check that Supabase is properly configured
- Verify that RLS policies are set up

### Getting Help

1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify that all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure prompts were run in the correct order
4. Reference working examples for patterns
5. Check the specific prompt documentation for details

## File Structure

After running all prompts, your project should have:

```
src/
├── components/          # UI components (from Figma Make)
├── hooks/              # Custom hooks (useProjects, useAppSettings, etc.)
├── lib/                # External service integrations (Supabase, etc.)
├── utils/              # Utility functions (cache, validation, etc.)
├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
├── pages/              # Page components
├── services/           # Service layer (AI, audio, etc.)
└── shared/             # Shared utilities (extensions only)
```

## Success Metrics

After completing all relevant prompts, you should have:

- ✅ **Performance**: Fast loading, smooth interactions, optimized bundle size
